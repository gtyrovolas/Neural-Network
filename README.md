# Neural-Network

A Neural Network developed in the context of the IB extended essay. Implements its own matrix multiplication and numerical differentiation. 
Was used to solve dummy problems (for instance predicting the value of sine).  The implementation is based on the excellent introductory video series
by Welch Labs, [Neural Networks Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU).
